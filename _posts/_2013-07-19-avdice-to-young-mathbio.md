title: Ken's Advice
---

"Have you seen this note by Ken before?" my friend Ake asked me the other day. [Ken](http://research.mednet.ucla.edu/institution/personnel?personnel_id=45702) is my post-doc mentor. We've written about 20 papers together but I don't know the existence of this note, titled [_Advice to Young Mathematical Biologists_](/media/pdf/Lange-Advice.pdf). I never see Ken preach at anyone, as far as my memory goes. Probably that's why he never bothers to publish this note.

Here is one I really wish someone told me when I was in college:  
  
> Get a broad undergraduate education in the sciences, emphasizing biology, chemistry, classical physics, applied mathematics, computer science, and statistics …  
> Enroll in medical school if strongly motivated … Skip the prolonged residency programs after medical school. Do you want to reach middle age before you embark on research?

I spent 6 years in a medical school and ended up wondering whether I really want to be a doctor. I had one semester of linear algebra and calculus and one semester of probability and statistics. I heard about Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium from the elective epidemiology course. That's about all quantitative training I got in college. Now I'm making a living by doing/teaching statistics and enjoy it. So often I'm regretting what if I learn more math in college!

I, perhaps like many other junior faculty, am juggling all the time: teaching new courses, writing papers and selling them to journals, attending numerous meetings, taking care of students, and, the most demanding part, struggling with two kids at home … 
> Other things being equal, finish the job that is nearest done.  

Ken quotes Fred Mosteller (my PhD advisor's PhD advisor). Each morning I refer to this advice 8(e).

Several of Ken's advice on writing draw on the classic *The Elements of Style* by Strunk and White. I later bought this little book from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/The-Elements-Style-Fourth-Edition/dp/020530902X/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1374269632&sr=8-1e), and found it the best investment of my $9. Succinct and dictatorial rules by the authors of this classic are easier to remember, or better put, not dare to forget.

Complement to the Strunk and White, which is for general writing style, the book *A Primer of Mathematical Writing* by Krantz is more oriented toward mathematical writing. [Guenther Walther](http://www-stat.stanford.edu/people/faculty/walther/) recommended this to all fresh PhD students at Stanford. I followed his advice and bought it, but never read it until later into my career. It covers useful tips for composing mathematical papers, cv, recommendation later, reviews, and seminar talks.
