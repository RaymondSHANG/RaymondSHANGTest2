### Welcome!

I'm Yuan SHANG, I'm a Bioinformatician in Dr.Roberta Brinton's Lab at CIBS (https://www.cibs.uahs.arizona.edu/). 

My main research interests are:

•	Precision medicine

•	Multi-omics

•	Big data

•	Alzheimer's Disease

My current research is mainly focusing on computational biology, searching for new therapeutic opportunities for 
Alzheimer’s Disease: 

•	Develop multi-scale network integration methods to explore potential beneficial mechanisms in drug development. 
I integrated all previous accumulated various omics data of both animal models and phase I clinic trial human datasets 
in the lab, and found potential mechanisms of how that drug could improve the patients. Network approach explains 
very well how our drug works. Together with all our other results, our phase 2 clinic trial was approved in August 2019.

•	Explore new drug targets for Alzheimer’s Disease. My current effort is mainly focusing on disease classification 
based on various publicly available datasets (including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics). 
Alzheimer’s has distinct pathologies based on the multi-omics network, and I’m building prediction model based on 
network and machine learning techniques. This work would definitely advance the field of personalized medicine and 
would lead to new drug targets for specific Alzheimer’s subtype.

•	Develop Novel factors that affect Alzheimer’s Disease progressions. Our data showed that life style and medicine 
treatment could affect AD progression dramatically. With the early access to the clinic data in AllOfUs dataset, 
together with UKbiobank dataset, I’m now actively exploring novel factors that affect the progressions of Alzheimer’s disease
using machine learning approaches.
